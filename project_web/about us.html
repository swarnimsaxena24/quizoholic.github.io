	<h1><b>About Us</b></h1>
<p>This website was made by:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Shruti Vashistha studying in Class 12B</b></li>
		<li><b>Swarnim Saxena studying in Class 12C</b></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>

	This website consists of two very interesting and interactive quizes that are:
	<ul type="square">
		<li><b>Bollywood Quiz</b></li>
		<li><b>General Knownledge Quiz</b></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The players would be given 10 questions in each type of quiz to answer. They can choose whichever topic's quiz they want to attempt and later can check the correct answers with their scores.<br><br>
	Players can also give us the feedback about the website, it will help us to remove bugs(if there) and to add more topic quizes to be played in future. They can also provide us their email to let them remind if we add more games/quizes to the website.<br><br><br>
